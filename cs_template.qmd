# Case study template instructions


## Section 1. Considerations for standardised coding in this case-study template


### General coding framework if using R

* When possible, use [tidyverse}, not {data.table}, no apply() functions, and avoid {base}
* Use a vertical approach to writing coding - easier to read
* Use spaces in your code
* Use lowercase and underscores in your object names
* For quick tabulations Use tabyl() from {janitor}, not table() from {base}
* Use the magrittr pipe %>%, not the native pipe
* Use  <-   not =


### Vocabulary

* Use **“Data frame”** instead of “dataset”
* Use **“Import (data)”** - avoid saying “read in” which doesn’t align with the import() function, and can be confusing to people who are not native english speakers. Reserve the word “load” for packages (see below).
* Use the word **“load”** for packages, as it aligns with the nomenclature of the p_load() function (or “install”, for the step prior to loading)
* Use **“Quotation marks”** vs. “Inverted commas” - “inverted” is a complicated word for non-native English speakers
* **Columns & Rows** vs. Variables & Observations



### Including figures
When including figures make sure that they are aligned to the centre and that the size is correct. To insert figures in quarto follow Quarto's [guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html)

You can also use the code below to insert an image that has been saved in a subfolder, as per this example.

```{r script-example, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 3, out.width = "25%", fig.cap = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Applied_Epi_logo.png", error = F)
```

### Including questions 
Please, include questions throughout the case study. If the questions included are "open", you can use the "Hints and Solutions" feature included in this template to suggest answers/reflections or propose coding solutions. If the questions foresee an specific answer, please use the {webexercises} package. You can find information and examples on how to use this package in their [website](https://psyteachr.github.io/webexercises/articles/webexercises.html) and in their [GitHub](https://github.com/psyteachr/webexercises).

To ensure that {webexercises} features are enabled, follow their instructions and download their webex.css and webex.js files. Then, make sure that you include those files in the format section of the YML, as per this document.

Here you find an example of a multiple choice question:

::: {.webex-check}

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
opts <- c(
  "Infectious period",
  "Susceptibility",
  answer = "Incubation period",
  "Communicability period"
)


cat("The time elapsed between exposure to a pathogen and the appearence of symptoms is known as:", longmcq(opts))

```
:::


### Unnumbered sections
Use {.unnumbered} after every heading so that they are not numbered in the final rendering 


<!-- Some considerations about about this quarto template 
-   Text within \<! \> will not show in your final document.
    -   The other parts such as slashes (///), dashes (-) and tildes (\~) are just aesthetic
    -   These comments are used to explain the code chunks.\
    -   We refer to functions in curly brackets, e.g. {dplyr} and functions end in brackets, e.g. count()\
    -   This comment will not show up when you knit the document.\
    -   You can delete them if you want.\ -->


<!--Below insert the name of the Case study. In curly brackets is the section reference name to be cross-references throughout the book -->

### Instructions

#### Getting Help

There are several ways to get help:

1)  Look for the "hints" and solutions (see below)
2)  Post a question in [Applied Epi Community](www.community.appliedepi.org) with reference to this case study

#### Hints and Solutions

Here is what the "helpers" look like:

<!--Note that this is the way of including hints and explanations to the solutions -->

```{=html}
<!--

-->
```
<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;">

`r fontawesome::fa("lightbulb", fill = "gold")` Click to read a hint

</summary>

</br>

Here you will see a helpful hint!

### Guidance

#### Objectives of this case study 

Here write an introduction to the case study specifying:
      1. Background
      2. Objectives/Learning outcomes
      3. What the users of the case study will learn
      4. Online references to both R code (e.g., EpiRhandbook) and to methodological documents
      

#### Previous level of expertise assumed

Add information of previous expertise needed to follow the case study. This includes expertise on:

* Epidemiological experience (e.g., knowledge of the foundations of survival analysis)
* Software experience (e.g, basic knowledge of R or Rmarkdown)

If appropriate and possible, include references  that can help the user to understand the level of expertise assumed


#### Preparation for the case study

Include the stepts needed to start replicating the analysis of the case study

For example:

1. Download folder named XXX and extract contents in the local laptop
2. Create an Rstudio project in the folder XXX (they already come with the project)
3. Subfolder data contains XXXX
4. Subfolder scripts should be used to save any scripts related to the analysis
5. Subfolder outputs will be used to store all outputs (tables, graphs, documents) that are the result of the analysis



## Section 3. Specific to the case study

Finally, add the different sections of the case study. Remember to include questions +/- hints and solutions as appropriate. 

We acknowledge that every case study is different, so we trust you to give it the most relevant structure. However, consider including the following sections:

1. Data import\
If using R, we recommend to use the import() function from the {rio} package to import data, and the here() function from the {here} package to recreate the file path in a reproducible way.

2. Data cleaning and preparation\
If using R, we prefer, to use {dplyr} functions linked through the {magrittr} pipe. 

3. Descriptive analysis\
If relevant, include a section on descriptive analysis divided into three parts: time, place, person. If using R, for the graphs, we recommend using {ggplot2}. For tables, {flextable}

4. Analysis
If appropriate include in a separate section more advanced analysis, such as multivariate regression, time series analysis or survival analysis.

5. Interpretation and reflection
Include this section if relevant


For case studies in R: remember to be consistent with the style represented by the [EpiRhandbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/).

Thank you for your work!
