## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars,  echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
pacman::p_load("webexercises")


opts <- c("install.package", 
            "install.packages", 
            answer = "library", 
            "libraries")

q1 <- mcq(opts)

cat("What function loads a package that is already on your computer?", q1)
```

```{r,echo=F}

opts_p <- c(
   "the probability that the null hypothesis is true",
   answer = "the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true",
   "the probability of making an error in your conclusion"
)


```

`r longmcq(opts_p)`

## Multiple Choice (`mcq()`)

- "Never gonna give you up, never gonna: `r mcq(c("let you go", "turn you down", "run away", answer = "let you down"))`"
- "I `r mcq(c(answer = "bless the rains", "guess it rains", "sense the rain"))` down in Africa" -Toto

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
opts <- c(
  "Una epidemia",
  "Una serie de casos",
  answer = "Un brote",
  "No se puede establecer"
)


cat("¿Ante que tipo de situación está presente el Dr Rubin?", longmcq(opts))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
