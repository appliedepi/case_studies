<!-- Some considerations about about this quarto template 
-   Text within \<! \> will not show in your final document.
    -   The other parts such as slashes (///), dashes (-) and tildes (\~) are just aesthetic
    -   These comments are used to explain the code chunks.\
    -   We refer to functions in curly brackets, e.g. {dplyr} and functions end in brackets, e.g. count()\

### Guidance

#### Objectives of this case study 

Here write an introduction to the case study specifying:
      1. Background
      2. Objectives/Learning outcomes
      3. What the users of the case study will learn
      4. Online references to both R code (e.g., EpiRhandbook) and to methodological documents
      

#### Previous level of expertise assumed

Add information of previous expertise needed to follow the case study. This includes expertise on:

* Epidemiological experience (e.g., knowledge of the foundations of survival analysis)
* Software experience (e.g, basic knowledge of R or Rmarkdown)

If appropriate and possible, include references  that can help the user to understand the level of expertise assumed


#### Preparation for the case study

Include the steps needed to start replicating the analysis of the case study

For example:

1. Download folder named XXXX and extract contents in the local laptop
2. Create an Rstudio project in the folder XXXX (they already come with the project)
3. Subfolder data contains XXXX
4. Subfolder scripts should be used to save any scripts related to the analysis
5. Subfolder outputs will be used to store all outputs (tables, graphs, documents) that are the result of the analysis



## Specific to the case study

Finally, add the different sections of the case study. Remember to include questions +/- hints and solutions as appropriate. 

We acknowledge that every case study is different, so we trust you to give it the most relevant structure. However, consider including the following sections:

1. Data import\
If using R, we recommend to use the import() function from the {rio} package to import data, and the here() function from the {here} package to recreate the file path in a reproducible way.

2. Data cleaning and preparation\
If using R, we prefer, to use {dplyr} functions linked through the {magrittr} pipe. 

3. Descriptive analysis\
If relevant, include a section on descriptive analysis divided into three parts: time, place, person. If using R, for the graphs, we recommend using {ggplot2}. For tables, {flextable}

4. Analysis
If appropriate include in a separate section more advanced analysis, such as multivariate regression, time series analysis or survival analysis.

5. Interpretation and reflection
Include this section if relevant


For case studies in R: remember to be consistent with the style represented by the [EpiRhandbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/).

Thank you for your work!
