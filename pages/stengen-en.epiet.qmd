## Guidance

### Objectives of this case study

At the end of this case study, participants should:
-   know and be able to perform the fundamental steps of a descriptive statistical analysis of a foodborne outbreak (including quantitative assessment (frequency distributions, missing values, means/medians/modes, quartiles/SDs) and visualization of the data (histogram, boxplot))
-   be able to perform univariate statistical analysis to identify potential vehicles of a foodborne outbreak (including risk ratios and/or odds ratios, depending on the design)
-   know why and how stratification can be conducted in datasets related to an outbreak investigation
-   be able to conduct a stratified analysis with respect to potential risk factors and confounders/effect modifiers
-   know how to use multivariable methods to quantify potential risk factors and control for confounding and/or effect modification


### Previous level of expertise assumed

Participants are expected to be familiar with data management and basic analysis in R.

### Preparation for the case study

1.  Download folder named stengen_mva and extract contents in the local
    laptop

2.  Create an Rstudio project in the folder stengen_en. If you are unsure on
    how to do that, read the EpiRhandbook Chapter on [R
    projects](https://epirhandbook.com/en/new_pages/r_projects.html)

3.  Inside the folder "stengen_en": Subfolder "data" contains a raw data
    file named *tira.csv*. This is the only data file you will use in
    this case study.

4.  Subfolder scripts should be used to save any scripts related to the
    analysis. Inside "backup" you will find a solution script with the
    code of the case study named *stengen_mva_backup.R*. 

5.  Subfolder "outputs" could be used to store all outputs (tables,
    graphs, documents) that are the result of the analysis


# **Part 1 - Scenario, study design and analysis plan**
## Introduction 

On 26 June 1998, the St Sebastian High School in Stegen (school A), Germany, celebrated a graduation party, where 250 to 350 participants were expected. Attendees included graduates from that school, their families and friends, teachers, 12th grade students and some graduates from a nearby school (school B).

A self-service party buffet was supplied by a commercial caterer in Freiburg. Food was prepared on the day of the party and transported in a refrigerated van to the school.  

Festivities started with a dinner buffet which opened from 8:30 pm onwards and were followed by a dessert buffet offered from 10 pm. The party and the buffet extended late during the night and alcoholic beverages were quite popular. All agreed it was a party to be remembered.


## The alert

On 2nd July 1998, the Freiburg local health office reported to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin the occurrence of many cases of gastroenteritis following the graduation party described above. More than 100 cases were suspected among attendees and some of them were admitted to nearby hospitals. Sick people suffered from fever, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting that lasted for several days. Most believed that the tiramisu consumed at dinner was responsible for their illness. Salmonella Enteritidis was isolated from 19 stool samples. 

The Freiburg health office sent a team to investigate the kitchen facilities of the caterer. Food preparation procedures were reviewed. Food samples, except tiramisu (none was left over), were sent to the laboratory of Freiburg University. Microbiological analyses were performed on samples of the following: brown chocolate mousse, caramel cream, remoulade sauce, yoghurt dill sauce and 10 raw eggs.  
 
The Freiburg health office requested help from the RKI in the investigation to assess the magnitude of the outbreak and identify potential vehicle(s) and risk factors for transmission in order to better control the outbreak.


## The study

Cases were defined as any person who had attended the party at St Sebastian High School who suffered from diarrhoea (‚â• 3 loose stool for 24 hours) between 27 June and 29 June 1998; or who suffered from at least three of the following symptoms: vomiting, fever ‚â•38.5¬∞C, nausea, abdominal pain, and headache.

Students from both schools attending the party were asked through phone interviews to provide names of persons who attended the party. 

Overall, 291 responded to enquiries and 103 cases were identified (attack rate: 35%). Among these cases, 84 (82%) received medical treatment and four were admitted to hospitals. Attack rates by age group were 36.6% for persons <20 years, 32.1% for persons 20 to 29 years, and 36.8% for persons older than 29 years.

**QUESTION 1**. What would be your hypothesis concerning the source of the outbreak?

<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">

`r fontawesome::fa("check", fill = "red")`Click to see the solution

</summary>

</br>

The shape of the epidemic curve and the attendance to a single event (a buffet) pointed towards a foodborne outbreak related to a point source of infection.

</br>

</details>


**QUESTION 2**. What study design would you choose to test this hypothesis?

<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">

`r fontawesome::fa("check", fill = "red")`Click to see the solution

</summary>

</br>

Using the updated list of attendants, a retrospective cohort study including all attendants to the party (that could be reached) was conducted. All had received a standard questionnaire asking for demographic information, signs, symptoms and duration, admission to hospital, and food and beverages consumption at the party including amount consumed. Food-specific attack rates were computed for more than 50 food items and beverages.


</br>

</details>

**Question 3**. What would your overall plan of analysis be?

<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">

`r fontawesome::fa("check", fill = "red")`Click to see the solution

</summary>

</br>

**Perform data cleaning**
-   For each variable, look at the range, unexpected and missing values.
-   Correct data using the original forms used if needed 

**Describe each variable**
-   For each variable, describe frequency distributions including missing values and, if needed, means, median, modes, quartiles, standard deviation, outliers 
-   Make appropriate histograms and box plots
-   Choose relevant characteristics to describe the population

**Identify the outbreak vehicle if any**
-   Chose the appropriate measure of association
-   Chose the appropriate statistical tests and significance level
-   Calculate food-specific attack rates
-   Look at the proportions of cases exposed
-   Calculate the percentages of cases exposed to each exposure
-   Search for any dose-response relationship if appropriate
-   Interpret the results

**Perform a stratified analysis**
-   Identify the variables that are potential effect modifiers (EM) and confounders
-   Design appropriate stratification tables
-   Stratify on each level taken by the EM and confounders
-   Compute appropriate measurements to identify confounding and effect modification
-   conduct appropriate statistical tests
-   Interpret the results

**Perform a multivariable analysis**
-   This will be discussed during the module.

# **Part 2 - Descriptive, univariate and stratified analysis with R**

### **Step 1: Set up**

#### Step 1.1: Create a new R script

Once you have created an Rproject inside the "stengen_mva" folder (as
specified in the second point of the section **Preparation for the case
study**). Create a new script with the name *stengen_analysis* and save it in the
subfolder "scripts". If you are familiar with Rmarkdown, you may decide
to use this type of file instead of a standard R script.

#### Step 1.2: Define R language

Depending on where you are and how you carried out R installation, your
language "locale" might be different from the language of the graphs
that you want to produce. For example, a french person might have a
french "locale". If that is the case, when creating a graph by day of
the week, Monday will be displayed as "lundi". If that french person
wants to create an English report, as for this case study, the language
"locale" should be changed.

**Task**: Ensure your "locale" is in English and change it into English
if it is not. If you don't know how to do this try finding it online
(searching for online help is an important skill for R users!).
Otherwise, see the solution below

`r fontawesome::fa("check", fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try
it yourself first!)

</summary>

</br>

```{r , echo=TRUE, results = 'hide'}
# To see your language locale
Sys.getlocale()

# To change it into English
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "English")

```

</br>

</details>

#### Step 1.3: Install/load packages

Install and load the following packages: rio, skimr, janitor, gtsummary,
broom, rstatix, ggfortify and tidyverse.

You can find more about installing/loading packages in the
[Packages](https://epirhandbook.com/en/new_pages/basics.html#packages)
section of the EpiRhandbook.

<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;">

`r fontawesome::fa("lightbulb", fill = "gold")` Click to read a hint

</summary>

</br>

You may end up using a long list of packages. Unfortunately different
packages have functions with the same name. For example, the package
{dplyr} (already installed with {tidyverse}) has a function called
`select()` which we frequently use to subset columns of a data frame.
But other packages such as {MASS} do also have a function called
`select()`. This could create headaches if you want to subset columns
using dplyr's `select()` but R thinks you're calling MASS's `select()`
(we call this masking - `dplyr::select()` is masked by
`MASS::select()`). Given that you are more likely to use functions from
{tidyverse}, ensure that this is the last package in your `p_load()`
list so that functions from {tidyverse} (including {dplyr} functions)
will always "prevail".

</summary>

</br>

```{r , echo=TRUE, results = 'hide'}
# Ensures the package "pacman" is installed
if (!require("pacman")) {
     install.packages("pacman") }

pacman::p_load(
  
  rio,             # to import datasets
  skimr,           # for displaying your data
  janitor,         # a package for data cleaning
  gtsummary,       # to create frequency tables
  rstatix,         # to generate summary statistics
  EpiStats,        # for univariable and stratified analysis
  tidyverse  # data management and visualization
)

```

</br>

</details>

### **Step 2: Import and explore data**

```{r, include=FALSE}
tira <- import("../cs/ENG/stengen_mva/data/tira.csv")
```

#### Step 2.1: Import the data 

**Task** Import the data frame called "tira.csv" inside the "data" subfolder. 

<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;">

`r fontawesome::fa("lightbulb", fill = "gold")` Click to read a hint

</summary>

</br>

If you are working within a project, finding the path to the dataframe
should be relatively straightfoward. A ".csv" file is a "Comma-separated Values" file. .
You can import this dataframe using the `read.csv()` which comes already pre-installed in R.
However, we recommend that you use the **`import()`** function
from {rio} because, as you may remember, this function will recognise
the file type and import it whether the file is from R, Stata, excel or
many others. If you have any doubts about importing review the [Import
and
export](https://epirhandbook.com/en/new_pages/importing.html#import-data)
chapter of the EpiRhandbook.

```{r , echo=TRUE, results = 'hide', eval=FALSE}
# Import the dataset 'tira.csv'  
tira_raw <- import("data/tira.csv") 
```


</br>

</details>


#### Step 2.2: Explore the data 

**Task**: Explore the data trying to answer the following questions:


::: webex-check
```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(webexercises)

opts <- c(
  "522 and 8",
  "2 and 345",
  answer = "291 and 21",
  "600 and 23"
)


cat("QUESTION: How many rows and columns does the dataframe have?", longmcq(opts))

```
:::



::: {.webex-check}

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(webexercises)

opts <- c(
  answer = "8",
  "14",
  "1",
  "0"
)


cat("QUESTION: How many cases have 'age' missing?", longmcq(opts))

```
:::

::: {.webex-check}

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(webexercises)

opts <- c(
  "factor",
  answer = "integer",
  "character",
  "logical"
)


cat("QUESTION: What is the class of the column 'salmon'?", longmcq(opts))

```
:::


::: {.webex-check}

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(webexercises)

opts <- c(
  "factor",
  "character",
  answer = "date",
  "numeric"
)


cat("QUESTION: What is the class of the column 'dateonset'?", longmcq(opts))

```
:::

::: {.webex-check}

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(webexercises)

opts <- c(
  answer = "106",
  "20",
  "474",
  "30"
)


cat("QUESTION: How many cases drank beer at the party?", longmcq(opts))

```

</br>

An efficient way to explore data is to use the function `skim()` from the {skimr} package, as it gives you all the information needed with only one command. Of course, there are several alternatives. You can also have a look at `glimpse()` from {dplyr}, for example.

```{r , echo=TRUE, results = 'hide', eval=FALSE}
# Inspect your dataset and generate basic statistics using the skim function  
skim(tira_raw)

glimpse(tira_raw)
```


</br>

</details>


### **Step 3 Clean the data**

You might notice that most of the columns are of class 'integer'. However, most variables consist out of 1 (present) and 0 (absent) values. For some of the following analyses, we will need R to treat these variables as factors (i.e., categorical variables). 

**Task**: Change all present (1) / absent (0) variables from integer to factors.

</summary>

</br>

You can do this one by one, or you could do all at the same time using the `across()` function from {dplyr}. If you are not sure how to use the `across()` function, read the section on [Transform multiple columns](https://epirhandbook.com/en/new_pages/cleaning.html#clean_across) from the EpiRhandbook.

  mutate(ill = as.factor(ill)) %>% 
  
  # this would change all columns we are interested into 'factors' in only one command
  mutate(across(.cols = !c(uniquekey, dateonset, age, mportion, tportion), # with the exclamation mark before c() we are telling R that we want all columns, except those in the c() list, to be transformed into factors
