## Guidance

### Objectives of this case study

At the end of this case study, participants should:

-   know and be able to perform the fundamental steps of a descriptive statistical analysis of a foodborne outbreak (including quantitative assessment (frequency distributions, missing values, means/medians/modes, quartiles/SDs) and visualization of the data (histogram, boxplot))

-   be able to perform univariate statistical analysis to identify potential vehicles of a foodborne outbreak (including risk ratios and/or odds ratios, depending on the design)

-   know why and how stratification can be conducted in datasets related to an outbreak investigation

-   be able to conduct a stratified analysis with respect to potential risk factors and confounders/effect modifiers


### Previous level of expertise assumed

Participants are expected to be familiar with data management and basic analysis in R.

### Preparation for the case study

1.  Download folder named *stengen_mva* and extract contents in the local
    laptop

2.  Create an Rstudio project in the folder *stengen_mva* If you are unsure on
    how to do that, read the EpiRhandbook Chapter on [R
    projects](https://epirhandbook.com/en/new_pages/r_projects.html)

3.  Inside the folder *stengen_mva*: Subfolder "data" contains a raw data
    file named *tira.csv*. This is the only data file you will use in
    this case study. In the same folder you can find the **data dictionary** with
    a description of the dataframe variables.
    
4.  Subfolder scripts should be used to save any scripts related to the
    analysis. Inside "backup" you will find a solution script with the
    code of the case study named *stengen_analysis_backup.R*. 

5.  Subfolder "outputs" could be used to store all outputs (tables,
    graphs, documents) that are the result of the analysis


# **Part 1 - Scenario, study design and analysis plan**
## Introduction 

On 26 June 1998, the St Sebastian High School in Stegen (school A), Germany, celebrated a graduation party, where 250 to 350 participants were expected. Attendees included graduates from that school, their families and friends, teachers, 12th grade students and some graduates from a nearby school (school B).

A self-service party buffet was supplied by a commercial caterer in Freiburg. Food was prepared on the day of the party and transported in a refrigerated van to the school.  

Festivities started with a dinner buffet which opened from 8:30 pm onwards and were followed by a dessert buffet offered from 10 pm. The party and the buffet extended late during the night and alcoholic beverages were quite popular. All agreed it was a party to be remembered.


## The alert

On 2nd July 1998, the Freiburg local health office reported to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin the occurrence of many cases of gastroenteritis following the graduation party described above. More than 100 cases were suspected among attendees and some of them were admitted to nearby hospitals. Sick people suffered from fever, nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting that lasted for several days. Most believed that the tiramisu consumed at dinner was responsible for their illness. Salmonella Enteritidis was isolated from 19 stool samples. 

The Freiburg health office sent a team to investigate the kitchen facilities of the caterer. Food preparation procedures were reviewed. Food samples, except tiramisu (none was left over), were sent to the laboratory of Freiburg University. Microbiological analyses were performed on samples of the following: brown chocolate mousse, caramel cream, remoulade sauce, yoghurt dill sauce and 10 raw eggs.  
 
The Freiburg health office requested help from the RKI in the investigation to assess the magnitude of the outbreak and identify potential vehicle(s) and risk factors for transmission in order to better control the outbreak.


## The study

Cases were defined as any person who had attended the party at St Sebastian High School who suffered from diarrhoea (≥ 3 loose stool for 24 hours) between 27 June and 29 June 1998; or who suffered from at least three of the following symptoms: vomiting, fever ≥38.5°C, nausea, abdominal pain, and headache.

Students from both schools attending the party were asked through phone interviews to provide names of persons who attended the party. 

Overall, 291 responded to enquiries and 103 cases were identified (attack rate: 35%). Among these cases, 84 (82%) received medical treatment and four were admitted to hospitals. Attack rates by age group were 36.6% for persons <20 years, 32.1% for persons 20 to 29 years, and 36.8% for persons older than 29 years.

**QUESTION 1**. What would be your hypothesis concerning the source of the outbreak?

<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">

`r fontawesome::fa("check", fill = "red")`Click to see the solution

</summary>

</br>

The shape of the epidemic curve and the attendance to a single event (a buffet) pointed towards a foodborne outbreak related to a **point source of infection.**

</br>

</details>


**QUESTION 2**. What study design would you choose to test this hypothesis?

<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">

`r fontawesome::fa("check", fill = "red")`Click to see the solution

</summary>

</br>

Using the updated list of attendants, a **retrospective cohort study** including all attendants to the party (that could be reached) was conducted. All had received a standard questionnaire asking for demographic information, signs, symptoms and duration, admission to hospital, and food and beverages consumption at the party including amount consumed. Food-specific attack rates were computed for more than 50 food items and beverages.


</br>

</details>

**Question 3**. What would your overall plan of analysis be?

<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">

`r fontawesome::fa("check", fill = "red")`Click to see the solution

</summary>

</br>

**Perform data cleaning**

-   For each variable, look at the range, unexpected and missing values.

-   Correct data using the original forms used if needed 

**Describe each variable**

-   For each variable, describe frequency distributions including missing values and, if needed, means, median, modes, quartiles, standard deviation, outliers 

-   Make appropriate histograms and box plots

-   Choose relevant characteristics to describe the population

**Identify the outbreak vehicle if any**

-   Calculate food-specific attack rates

-   Look at the proportions of cases exposed

-   Chose the appropriate measure of association

-   Chose the appropriate statistical tests and significance level

-   Calculate the percentages of cases exposed to each exposure

-   Search for any dose-response relationship if appropriate

-   Interpret the results

**Perform a stratified analysis**

-   Identify the variables that are potential effect modifiers (EM) and confounders

-   Design appropriate stratification tables

-   Stratify on each level taken by the EM and confounders

-   Compute appropriate measurements to identify confounding and effect modification

-   Conduct appropriate statistical tests

-   Interpret the results

**Perform a multivariable analysis**

-   This will be discussed during the module.

# **Part 2 - Descriptive, univariate and stratified analysis with R**

### **Step 1: Set up**

#### Step 1.1: Create a new R script

Once you have created an Rproject inside the "stengen_mva" folder (as
specified in the second point of the section **Preparation for the case
study**). Create a new script with the name *stengen_analysis* and save it in the
subfolder "scripts". If you are familiar with Rmarkdown, you may decide
to use this type of file instead of a standard R script.

#### Step 1.2: Define R language

Depending on where you are and how you carried out R installation, your
language "locale" might be different from the language of the graphs
that you want to produce. For example, a french person might have a
french "locale". If that is the case, when creating a graph by day of
the week, Monday will be displayed as "lundi". If that french person
wants to create an English report, as for this case study, the language
"locale" should be changed.

**Task**: Ensure your "locale" is in English and change it into English
if it is not. If you don't know how to do this try finding it online
(searching for online help is an important skill for R users!).
Otherwise, see the solution below

`r fontawesome::fa("check", fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try
it yourself first!)

</summary>

</br>

```{r , echo=TRUE, results = 'hide'}
# To see your language locale
Sys.getlocale()

# To change it into English
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "English")

```

</br>

</details>

#### Step 1.3: Install/load packages

Install and load the following packages: rio, skimr, janitor, gtsummary,
rstatix, epitools, epiR, epikit and tidyverse.

You can find more about installing/loading packages in the
[Packages](https://epirhandbook.com/en/new_pages/basics.html#packages)
section of the EpiRhandbook.

<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;">

`r fontawesome::fa("lightbulb", fill = "gold")` Click to read a hint

</summary>

</br>

You may end up using a long list of packages. Unfortunately different
packages have functions with the same name. For example, the package
{dplyr} (already installed with {tidyverse}) has a function called
`select()` which we frequently use to subset columns of a data frame.
But other packages such as {MASS} do also have a function called
`select()`. This could create headaches if you want to subset columns
using dplyr's `select()` but R thinks you're calling MASS's `select()`
(we call this masking - `dplyr::select()` is masked by
`MASS::select()`). Given that you are more likely to use functions from
{tidyverse}, ensure that this is the last package in your `p_load()`
list so that functions from {tidyverse} (including {dplyr} functions)
will always "prevail".

</summary>

</br>

```{r , echo=TRUE, results = 'hide'}
# Ensures the package "pacman" is installed
if (!require("pacman")) {
     install.packages("pacman") }

pacman::p_load(
  
  rio,             # to import datasets
  skimr,           # for displaying your data
  janitor,         # a package for data cleaning
  gtsummary,       # to create frequency tables
  rstatix,         # to generate summary statistics
  epitools,        # for univariable analysis
  epikit,          # for creating age categories
  epiR,            # for the adjusted risk ratios across strata
  tidyverse  # data management and visualization
)

```

</br>

</details>

### **Step 2: Import and explore data**

```{r, include=FALSE}
tira_raw <- import("../cs/ENG/stengen_mva/data/tira.csv")
```

#### Step 2.1: Import the data 

**Task** Import the data frame called "tira.csv" inside the "data" subfolder. 

<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;">

`r fontawesome::fa("lightbulb", fill = "gold")` Click to read a hint

</summary>

</br>

If you are working within a project, finding the path to the dataframe
should be relatively straightfoward. A ".csv" file is a "Comma-separated Values" file.
You can import this dataframe using the `read.csv()` which comes already pre-installed in R.
However, we recommend that you use the **`import()`** function
from {rio} because, as you may remember, this function will recognise
the file type and import it whether the file is from R, Stata, excel or
many others. If you have any doubts about importing review the [Import
and
export](https://epirhandbook.com/en/new_pages/importing.html#import-data)
chapter of the EpiRhandbook.

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Import the dataset 'tira.csv'  
tira_raw <- import("data/tira.csv") 
```


</br>

</details>



#### Step 2.2: Explore the data 

**Task**: Explore the data trying to answer the following questions:


::: webex-check
```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(webexercises)

opts <- c(
  "522 and 8",
  "2 and 345",
  answer = "291 and 20",
  "600 and 23"
)


cat("QUESTION: How many rows and columns does the dataframe have?", longmcq(opts))

```
:::



::: {.webex-check}

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(webexercises)

opts <- c(
  answer = "8",
  "14",
  "1",
  "0"
)


cat("QUESTION: How many cases have 'age' missing?", longmcq(opts))

```
:::

::: {.webex-check}

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(webexercises)

opts <- c(
  "factor",
  answer = "integer",
  "character",
  "logical"
)


cat("QUESTION: What is the class of the column 'salmon'?", longmcq(opts))

```
:::

::: {.webex-check}

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(webexercises)

opts <- c(
  "83%",
  "70%",
  answer = "29%",
  "6%"
)


cat("QUESTION: What percentage of attendees ate tomato?", longmcq(opts))

```
:::

::: {.webex-check}

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(webexercises)

opts <- c(
  "factor",
  "character",
  answer = "date",
  "numeric"
)


cat("QUESTION: What is the class of the column 'dateonset'?", longmcq(opts))

```
:::

::: {.webex-check}

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(webexercises)

opts <- c(
  "As 'NA'",
  "As empy spaces",
  "With an 'Unknown' cateogry",
  answer = "With the number 9"
)


cat("QUESTION: How are missing categorised in the variables 'salmon', 'horseradish' and 'pork'?", longmcq(opts))

```

</br>

An efficient way to explore data is to use the function `skim()` from the {skimr} package, as it gives you all the information needed with only one command. Of course, there are several alternatives. You can also have a look at `glimpse()` from {dplyr}, for example.
An easy way to explore single variables that have categories is to use `tabyl()` from {janitor}

</br>

```{r , echo=TRUE}
# Inspect your dataset and generate basic statistics using the skim function  
skim(tira_raw)
# Glimpse is an alternative to skim which gives more accurate information about the nature of the  variables
glimpse(tira_raw)
# To see the different categories of the variables
tabyl(tira_raw, tomato)

```


</br>

</details>


#### Step 2.3: Explore age in more detail 

**Task** Explore the age of attendees by: 

- Getting summary statistics

- Generating a boxplot of age by illness status.


<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;">

`r fontawesome::fa("lightbulb", fill = "gold")` Click to read a hint

</summary>

</br>

You can create a boxplot with {ggplot2} by using the geom `geom_boxplot()`.  In order to create two boxes, one for each illness status, you can assign in the aesthetics the column *ill* to both the x-axis and the fill. Don't worry if it doesn't look good right now....it should look like the solution below. If you need a refresher on how ggplot works, have a look at the EpiRhandbook [Chapter](https://epirhandbook.com/new_pages/ggplot_basics.html)

:::

We were not able to create the boxplot that we aimed for. In fact, you can see that a warning message appeared in your console saying: "Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical variable into a factor?"

Looks like all columns that consist of 1 (present) and 0 (absent) values are of class 'integer', including "ill". Integer means that they are considered numbers. However, we want them to be categories, otherwise we won't be able to carry out many of the analysis we want (including this boxplot). So, now we'll sort this out alongside other cleaning operations.  

### **Step 3: Clean the data**

#### Step 3.1: Transform categorical variables
**Task**: Change all present (1) / absent (0) variables from integer to factors. Do the same for the variables that record the number of portions eaten.

You can do this one by one, or you could do all at the same time using the `across()` function from {dplyr}. If you are not sure how to use the `across()` function, read the section on [Transform multiple columns](https://epirhandbook.com/en/new_pages/cleaning.html#clean_across) from the EpiRhandbook.

#### Step 3.2: Categorise "missing" as NA
We saw with the `skim()` overview -and in the data dictionary- that the variables *salmon*, *pork* and *horseradish* have 'missing' codified with number '9'. In most analysis and visualisations, it is very important that R considers missing data truly as "missing". To do that, missing data needs to be coded as NA (**without quotes**). Other codifications of missing data, such as empty spaces or the number 9 (as in this case) will mean that R will treat this data as a category or a number. For R, 9 is not different from number 1.

**Task** Recode the columns salmon, pork and horseradish so that values of 9 are coded as NA. Add the new code to the cleaning pipeline initiated in the previous step

</br>

For this task you can use the `mutate()` function in combination with `recode()` or `if_else()`. The former is used specifically for recoding, whereas the latter is used to create/modify columns based on logical conditions. In any case, functions like `if_else()` and `recode()` may require you to specify the type of NA (e.g., NA_character_, NA_real_, NA_integer_) to ensure that the resulting vector maintains a consistent data type. This is important because R is strongly typed, meaning that each vector must contain elements of the same type.
If you want to know more about recoding, read the EpiRhandbook section on [Recoding](https://epirhandbook.com/new_pages/cleaning.html#re-code-values). Regardless of the approach that you choose, add it to the cleaning pipe command you started before, so that your code is tidy.

#### Step 3.3: Re-categorise mousse and tiramisu portions
We saw that there are two columns -*tportion* and *mportion*- that have four categories according to the number of portions eaten. However, exploring these columns we can see that few people ate 3 portions. The low number in this category means that it will be very difficult to have meaningful results due to the wide uncertainty that we'll find in the estimates.

**Task**: Re-categorise these columns so that they have three categories: 0,1 and 2+ portions eaten. Add the new code to the cleaning pipeline initiated previously.

We will now use the `mutate()` function in combination with `if_else()`. As specified above, this function is used for simple logical recoding, which is what we want to do now. There are three "partner" functions called `if_else()` from {dplyr}, `ifelse()` from {base} and `fifelse()` from {data.table}. They all have the same syntax. `ifelse()` has the advantage of being embedded in R, which guarantees its stability and sustainability. `if_else()` has some advantages compared to `ifelse()` that are important in epi analysis. For example, it does not convert Date objects to numeric (which can be a headache) and verifies that both alternatives in the if and else statements are of the same class. Finally, `fifelse()` is the fastest, so it has its advantages when we're analysis a large database.

If you want to know more about simple logical recoding, have a look at the dedicated [section](https://epirhandbook.com/new_pages/cleaning.html#ifelse-and-if_else) of the EpiRhandbook.

### **Step 4: Descriptive analysis**

Now that we have explored and cleaned our data, we can start with the descriptive analysis. As you know, we normally describe the data by time, person and place. We won't do the "place" analysis because in this outbreak, that element is not relevant.

#### Step 4.2: Analysis by time

**Task**: Generate an epidemic curve with the dates of onset. Display in the x-axis each day of the study period.

<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;">

`r fontawesome::fa("lightbulb", fill = "gold")` Click to read a hint

</summary>

</br>

You should be able, by now, to create the histogram required for this epicurve. For the x-axis breaks, remember there are two distinct elements in a `ggplot()`. Inside `geom_histogram()` we can specify the `binwidth =` of the bins to the unit we want (e.g, 1 for daily, 7 for weekly etc.). This will change the whole epicurve. 
The second element is the scale. Scales change the way the axis or the colours are displayed, but the epicurve remains the same. In this case, as we want to modify the X-axis which is a date, we should use the function `scale_x_date()` and specify inside that we want `date_breaks =` by "day".
If you are struggling, have a look at the [Epicurves](https://epirhandbook.com/new_pages/epicurves.html#epicurves-with-ggplot2) chapter of the EpiRhandbook.

#### Step 4.3: Analysis by person

There are several approaches to generate descriptive tables and cross-tabulations. You could use `tabyl()` from {janitor}, which is a very fast approach; or you could use `group_by()` in combination with `summarise()`, from {dplyr} which is the most flexible. In this case, however, we show you the solution with a very efficient approach: `tbl_summary()` from {gtsummary}

```
:::

### **Step 5: Develop and test hypothesis**

In the previous step we have described the number of ill attendees by date of onset, and we have described how sex and age were distributed according to illness status. The next step in an outbreak investigation would be to develop and test hypothesis about the possible source of the outbreak.

#### Step 5.1: Compute food-specific attack rates and % of cases exposed

**Task**: Create 2 by 2 tables with exposure and outcome and calculate the attack rates.

cat("QUESTION: What is the attack rate in those who ate white mousse?", longmcq(opts))

```
:::


#### Step 5.2: Estimate the relative risk of the different exposures

We have calculated attack rates in exposed and unexposed, which already gives us a lot of information. For example, we see little difference in the attack rates of those who ate and did not ate salmon; but we observe a much higher attack rate among those who ate tiramisu, than among those who did not eat it. We also see a higher attack rate in those who did not drink beer than in those who drank it.

To have a better understanding of the exposures, we will now calculate relative risks.

**Task**: First, estimate the relative risk for the exposure of having eaten white mousse at the dinner

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: darkgreen;">

</br>

You could do this manually, but you could use the function `riskratio()` from the package {epitools}, which will give you a lot of interesting information, besides the RR and its 95%CI. In this function, you need first to write the exposure and then the predictor. Try reading the documentation of the function if you have any doubts.

You could write the `riskratio()` function changing the exposure variable one by one. However, to save time, avoid making errors and being more efficient, you could try to use approaches that allow you to apply the same function to many different objects (e.g., multiple columns) simultaneously. There are different options for this such as *loops*, *lapply* or *purrr*. Here we give the solution with *purrr*, so if you want to explore further purrr have a look at the dedicated [section](https://epirhandbook.com/new_pages/iteration.html#iter_purrr) in the EpiRhandbook.

:::

Several food items seemed to be associated with the occurrence of illness; **tiramisu, dark and white chocolate mousse, fruit salad, and red jelly**. They can potentially explain up to 94, 76, 49, 46, and 45 of the 103 cases, respectively. Investigators decided to identify their respective roles in the occurrence of illness. There also seems to be a **dose-response** in the amount of tiramisu eaten, with those eating 2 or more portions having a higher risk than those eating only 1 (who had a higher risk than those who did not eat tiramisu)

From the crude analysis, epidemiologists noticed that the occurrence of **gastroenteritis was lower among those attendants who had drunk beer.** They also decided to assess if beer had a protective effect on the occurrence of gastroenteritis.

#### Step 5.3: Confounding and effect modification

The finding that beer had a protective effect on GI illness is surprising. One of your colleagues suggested that tiramisu might be confounding this association. Given that tiramisu has the highest risk ratio, it might be that the dessert is associated with the outcome (causes it) and to the exposure (those drinking beer might have preferred not to ruin its sour flavour with the sweetness of tiramisu). Another colleague disagrees and thinks that, actually, tiramisu might be an effect modifier in the relation between beer and illness.

QUESTION: How would you check if tiramisu is a confounder or an effect modifier in the association between beer and illness? 


<details>

<summary style="text-decoration: underline; color: red;">

`r fontawesome::fa("check", fill = "red")`Click to see a solution (try

</summary>

</br>

To check both things: confounding and effect modification, we should stratify our data by tiramisu consumption. Once stratified, we can calculate risk ratios in both strata and an adjusted risk ratio: **the adjusted Mantel–Haenszel risk ratio**. If this risk ratio is very different from the crude risk ratio (the overall risk ratio between beer and illness), we could say that tiramisu is confounding the association between beer and illness. We normally define as "very different" when: $(RRcrude/RRadjusted - 1)*100$ is larger than 10-20% difference (no strict threshold, your interpretation and expertise counts!).

If there is confounding but no effect modification, the adjusted M-H risk ratio should be different from the crude RR, but **the risk ratios in each strata -tiramisu yes and tiramisu no- should not be significantly different**. If they are significantly different then there is **effect modification**. How do we know if they are significantly different? We can run a test to tell us that called **the Mantel–Haenszel test of homogeneity**.

**Task**: Check if tiramisu is a confounder or an effect modifier in the association between beer and illness

Unfortunately `epi.2by2()` is a very "picky" function. Although you can pass data into `epi.2by2()` in different formats, the easiest way is to create a new data frame grouped by the three columns that we will use: tira, beer and ill. 
You could pass this new dataframe into `epi.2by2()` and it may work, but be careful. `epi.2by2()` will consider as *exposed* and as *ill* the first levels of your factor data, as per the image they have in the documentation and that we show you below:

![](../images/stengen/epi.2by2_data.png)
Now run this line of code `riskratio(tira_clean$beer, tira_clean$ill)` and look at the first part of the output. You should see something like this:

![](../images/stengen/beer_data_before.png)

As you see, in the top left (96) we have unexposed who did not become ill, but in the previous image we saw that `epi.2by2()` will consider those in the top left (a) as exposed and ill. How to overcome this? The trick is to change the levels of the factor variables. By default, they have "0" as first level and "1" as second level. So, we can add a line that changes  the order of the levels before we groups the data (See the solution if you don't know what its meant)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
### Group the dataframe
group_data <- tira_clean %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = c(tira, beer, ill), .fns = ~factor(.x, levels = c(1,0)))) %>% # we change the order of the levels
  group_by(tira, beer, ill) %>% # it's important to group them in this order: strata, exposure, outcome
  summarise(n = n()) 

### Run the function to obtain M-H estimates
strat_analysis <- epi.2by2(dat = group_data, method = "cohort.count",  # the method specifies that we are dealing with a cohort study
           conf.level = 0.95, outcome = "as.columns")                  # we set up confidence intervals to 95 and we specify that the outcome variable is a column in the data
#Print the results

You got several results. Let's now review them to make sense of them:

The first part is a table in which you get the overall table for the association between beer and illness.
The second part, titled *Point estimates and 95% CIs:* has different estimates depending on whether you're interested in risk ratios, odds ratios or attributable risks. As we are carrying out a cohort study, we're interested in the ones for **risk ratios**.

-   **Inc risk ratio (crude)**: The crude incidence risk ratio, comparing the risk of the outcome between exposed and unexposed groups, with 95% confidence intervals. In this case, this is the overall risk of illness in those who drank beer compared to those who did not drink it.

-   **Inc risk ratio (M-H):** The Mantel-Haenszel adjusted incidence risk ratio, accounting for stratification by tiramisu, with 95% confidence intervals.

-   **Inc risk ratio (crude:M-H):** The ratio of the crude incidence risk ratio to the Mantel-Haenszel adjusted incidence risk ratio.


This is all we need to evaluate confounding. As we said before, we need to evaluate if the crude and the adjusted risk ratios are very different. We said that we can do that with the formula $(RRcrude/RRadjusted - 1)*100$. Here, the **Inc risk ratio (crude:M-H):** corresponds to the first part: $RRcrude/RRadjusted$. So we need to substract 1 and multiple by 100: (0.87-1)*100. If you do that you'll get 13%, which is borderline, but we can say that tiramisu is not massively confounding the association between beer and illness.

To know whether there is effect modification, you can check the **M-H test of homogeneity of IRRs** in the lower part of the results. As it is not significant (p = 0.713), we can conclude there is no effect modification of tiramisu on the association between beer and illness.
