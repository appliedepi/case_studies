R and RStudio\nInstructions and links go here.\nDefine R Language\nDepending on where you are and how you carried out R installation, your language “locale” might be different from the language of the report that you want to produce. For example, a French person might have a French “locale”. If that is the case, when creating a graph by day of the week, Monday will be displayed as “lundi”. If that French person wants to create an English report, as for this case study, the language “locale” should be changed.\n\nTo ensure your “locale” is set to English, use the following code: \n```{r, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}\n# To see your language locale\nSys.getlocale()\n\n# To change it into English\nSys.setlocale(\"LC_ALL\", \"English\")\n```\n\nSet-up a RStudio Project and R script for the case study\nDownload the case study folder which can be found at the top of the case study page and extract the contents somewhere on your computer. \n\nIn your case study folder, you should have a \nsubfolder “scripts” should be used to save any scripts related to the analysis. Inside scripts there is another subfolder called “backup” \nsubfolder “data” which will contain the raw data you will use\nsubfolder “outputs” can be used to store any outputs (tables, graphs, documents) that are the result of the analysis.\n\nMake sure your folders/subfolders are well-organised as this will save you a headache later! \n\nCreate an Rstudio project in the case study folder. If you are unsure on how to do that, read the EpiRhandbook on R projects. Once you have created an Rproject, create a new script with an appropriate name (example mpox_rpractical) and save it in the subfolder “scripts”. \n\nIf you are familiar with Rmarkdown, you may decide to use this type of file instead of a standard R script. See Using Rmarkdown below for more instructions. \n\nMake sure the purpose, date last updated, and author are written as comments at the top.\n\n## Using Rmarkdown\nSome of our case studies use Rmarkdown and the code goes within “chunks”, which is different from a standard R script. If you want to create a reproducible workflow, you need a place to save your code so you can run it again if you need to. You want all your files easily organised so you don’t get lost later on. You need to begin by setting the default chunk options.\n\nTypically, you want to change the default chunk options of your Rmarkdown script to:\nhide all code chunks in the report\ndo not show messages or warnings\nshow errors if they appear, but to not stop the rendering\nset up the default figure width to 7 and the figure height to 6\nto show the figure titles on top of the plots by default\n\n```{r, eval = F, echo = T}\n# hide all code chunks in the output, but show errors \nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,  # hide all code chunks in output\n                      error = TRUE,  # show errors if they appear, but don't stop (produce the word doc)\n                      warning = FALSE, # do not show warnings in the output word doc \n                      message = FALSE, # do not show  messages in the output word doc\n                      fig.width = 7,         # Figure width\n                      fig.height = 6,        # Figure height\n                      fig.topcaption = TRUE  # show figure titles on top of plot\n                     )\n```\n\n### Install packages\n\nSeveral packages are required for different aspects of analysis with R. You will need to install these before starting. We install and load packages using the {pacman} package. Its p_load() command will install packages if necessary and load them for use in the current session. If a listed package has already been installed, it will just load it. Each case study specifies at the beginning what packages you need to have installed. You can find more about installing/loading packages in the Packages section of the EpiRhandbook.\n\nNote you may end up using a long list of packages. Unfortunately different packages have functions with the same name. For example, the package {dplyr} (already installed with {tidyverse}) has a function called select() which we frequently use to subset columns of a data frame. Other packages such as {MASS} also have a function called select(). This could create headaches if you want to subset columns using dplyr’s select() but R thinks you’re calling MASS’s select() (we call this masking - dplyr’s select() is masked by MASS’s select()). Given that you are more likely to use functions from {tidyverse}, ensure that this is the last package in your p_load() list so that functions from {tidyverse} (including {dplyr} functions) will always “prevail”.\n\n```{r, eval = F, echo = T}\n# Ensures the package \"pacman\" is installed\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) {\n     install.packages(\"pacman\") }\n\n# install (if necessary) from CRAN and load packages to be used\npacman::p_load(\n  rio,        # importing data  \n  skimr,      # get overview of data\n  janitor,    # data cleaning and tables\n  lubridate,  # working with dates\n  epikit,     # to create age categories\n  gtsummary,  # summary statistics, tests and regressions \n  apyramid,   # plotting age pyramids \n  tidyverse  # data management and visualization\n)\n```\n\nIf this step is not working, you may have limited administrative rights for your computer. Making sure your IT-department gives you the correct access can save a lot of headache.
